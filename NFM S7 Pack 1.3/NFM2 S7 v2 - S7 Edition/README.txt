GAME REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------

Basic knowledge of NEED FOR MADNESS & NEED FOR MADNESS 2.


B.
RUNNING NEED FOR MADNESS S7 V2
----------------------------------------

1. Click on Madness.
2. Click on Play Game.


C.
TROUBLESHOOTING AND TIPS FOR IMPROVING PERFORMANCE
----------------------------------------

1. Generally, the best resolution setting for the game tends to be 800 X 600.

2. If you receive an error message telling you to click for details. make sure you
have Java 7 update 21 or lower update and Click Control Panel -> Java -> Security 
-> Set to medium.

3. If your computer locks up or crashes while running the game, it may be
because you have other applications running in the background. You should close
all other applications and programs while you are running this game. This may
include internet connections.


D.
KNOWN PROBLEMS
----------------------------------------

1. Some users may experience after beating the game (stage 19), closing it and 
starting it again, that the game doesn't save your progress. It saves your
progress untill stage 18 and you need to beat stage 18 again if you close the game. 

2. After doing amazing stunt, the text if is too long might go over the chronometer.

3. Challenge mode. if you disable it by pressing O in car select and picking your
car and then pressing O again the car will have it's previous damage from last game
that you used the car and if the car got wasted, you use the car without any damage.
This problem breaks the challenge mode since the whole purpose is to see how well
you do when damage proceeds to next stage you're on and wasted cars can not be used.

4. Some cars might have to fix and they don't know where to go. they will do circles 
in one place.

5. Some cars might not know where the next checkpoint and they will lose their way.

6. Some tracks have checkpoints at an angle. to path the checkpoint you need to be
at the center when going. if you get close to the sides of the checkpoint you might
get launched into the air.

7. The game might freeze for several seconds (1-5 seconds). nothing to worry unless
it takes too long and then restart the game. the chronometer time will continue.


E.
