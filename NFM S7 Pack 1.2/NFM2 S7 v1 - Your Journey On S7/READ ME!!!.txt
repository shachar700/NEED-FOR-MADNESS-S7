Welcome to my 1st Need for Madness 2 version called, Need for Madness
S7. If you would take your time reading the
description(or until -the STOP- LINE):


  In this Need for Madness 2 version, all the stages are completely
  made by Shachar700. All of them
  except stages 8. Stage 12 is the original NFM2 track.
  
  - Night Demonsfor stage 8 is made by Azri965 (A9). I
    apologize to him for putting this track in this NFM2 version.
    I just wanted to put that level as stage 8 on my version.

  - the car "The Lord" made by AudiR8King. He said that I can use
    that car for my version so it will replace EL KING.

# Rules:

  - This NFM2 version is a racing, killing (wasting), and adventure
    edition. 17 new stages with 16 new/colored cars changed by me,
    Shachar700.
  - Do not copy anything without my premission
  - If you want to record you playing my version you must tell that
    this is NFMS7 (Shachar700's version) and to give credit.
  - This NFM2 version can be challenging, so try your best.
  - I wish you luck in this NFM2 version. :)
